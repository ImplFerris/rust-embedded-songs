# Rust Embedded Songs
This repository contains a collection of songs for embedded programming projects using Rust. 

It was converted from the [arduino-songs](https://github.com/robsoncouto/arduino-songs) repository, originally designed for Arduino, and other songs added for Rust-based projects.

## How to use?
Copy the `music.rs` and desire song `.rs` file to your project and configure it as module.
